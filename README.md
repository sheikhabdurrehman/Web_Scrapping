WEB SCRAPPING TO GET WEATHER DATA
I have just uploaded a script which is used to locate the user city location and weather by its IP address .
We only have to run the script the code will automatically gets the IP address (public IP) , then it locates the IP address and finds the city and its cordinates in Lattitude and longitude.
this location information is then used to get the weather data .Then the weather data is displayed in table.

I have used the weather website for pakistan you can use the web URL according to your country is this dont works.
